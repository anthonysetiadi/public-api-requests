# Startup Directory
Using the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/), this project's goal was to create an app that would allow for 12 random "employees" data to build a prototype for an employee directory.

## Description
Unit 5 Project for the purposes of completing the Team Treehouse Techdegree Fullstack JavaScript course.

This project uses JavaScript and a Public API to retrieve random users. These users are then displayed in a modal dynamically. Search, back and next functionality are also included.

## Functionality
1. Display Users
On load, the random users API is called and 12 random users are generated to display on the page.

2. Modal window
Upon clicking on an individual user, a modal window is displayed with the added functionality to interact with it including:
- Close button
- Close with Physical ESC key
- Close by clicking anywhere 'outside' the modal window
- Prev and Next buttons to toggle through the displayed users

## Styling
Main styling provided by Team Treehouse.
Specific styling changes include:
1. Main font family changed to Rubik and Work Sans
2. Color changes for background, cards, and modal
